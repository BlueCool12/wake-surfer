# realtime-chat-api app

`realtime-chat-api` is the deployable runtime shell for realtime chat API responsibilities.

The app owns runtime wiring only:

- load environment configuration
- create the PostgreSQL/Kysely runtime resource
- assemble `@wake-surfer/realtime-chat-gateway-ticket`
- expose Hono HTTP endpoints
- map domain rejections and infrastructure failures
- provide Pino logging and graceful shutdown

Gateway ticket rules and SQL remain owned by packages.

## Endpoints

```txt
GET  /health
POST /realtime-chat/gateway-tickets
POST /internal/realtime-chat/gateway-tickets/consume
```

`POST /realtime-chat/gateway-tickets` uses the authenticated actor context from
`REALTIME_CHAT_ACTOR_ID_HEADER`. It does not trust `actorId`, `userId`, or `workspaceId` from the request body.

`POST /internal/realtime-chat/gateway-tickets/consume` accepts only `{ "ticket": "..." }` in the JSON body.
The gateway identity is resolved from trusted gateway context, currently `REALTIME_CHAT_GATEWAY_ID_HEADER`
matched against `REALTIME_CHAT_GATEWAY_ID`.
